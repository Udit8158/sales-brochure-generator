## Version 1 planning

### Primary todos

- [x] User will input the company website url
- [x] We will first scrape the content of that url
- [x] Extract all the external link from the url
- [x] GPT model will tell what are the relevent links
- [x] Will scrape those sites
- [x] Provide all the data: from landing page content to relevent external pages, to GPT model to create the brochure
- [x] Will show the output first then
- [ ] Will make a downloadable pdf after approve

### Additional task came in mind

- [ ] Instead of giving raw text data from scraping to gpt model, structure the data in a way that gpt model can understand better
- [ ] Understand the project structure and make a better project structure
- [ ] UI of the response should be much better
